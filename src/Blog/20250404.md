I have been busy the past few weeks.  I got a rack mount case to transfer the nas server into.

I pulled all the school and all the general programing projects I could find and sort them into a [schools project](https://github.com/Kaden-Ven-Gryphon/school-projects) GitHub and a [mono rep](https://github.com/Kaden-Ven-Gryphon/mono). 

I got and finished building the Lego Titanic.

On the side as I have time between things I have been working on the design for my own 8bit processor architecture.  This is a continuation of a project that I keep coming back to off and on for the last 5+ years.  It lead to making the Assembly Academy project and the pngGates.  This time I am doing a lot more research and planning ahead of time, using rust, and am trying to make more general useful tools for it as I do so.  I think I have most of the design for the commands done, I just need to work more on the details like the memory map and block diagram.  In order to actually make it I have two tools to make.  The compiler and emulator that I started a bit ago.  I need to make a json config for my design and then update the kgemu to finish more of its features.  After I have a design running in kgemu that I like and think is functional enough I can start on the new version of a gates simulator and start building the computer in that.  This is a project that I have to do on the side and make sure I am getting progress on the home lab done too.
